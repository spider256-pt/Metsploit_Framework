The `Metasploit Project` is Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables users to:
- `write`
- `test`
- `execute the exploit code`
	- The exploit code can be custom made or can be taken from the database containing the latest already discovered and modularized exploits.
- `Metasploit-Framework` Includes a suite of tools that can be use to test:
	- `security vulnerabilities`
	- `enumerate  networks`
	- `execute attacks `
	- `evade detection`

- #### ==`modules`==:
	- are the actual exploit `proof-of-concept` that have already been developed and tested in the wild and integrated within the framework to provide ease of access to different attack vectors for different platform and services. 

- #### ==`msfconsole`==:
	- it provide all in one centralized console.
	- ##### features of msfconsole:
		- It only supports way to access most of the features within Metasploit.
		- Provides a console-based interface to the `Framework`
		- Contains the most features and is the most stable MSF interface.
		- Full read-line support, tabbing and command completion
		- Execution of external commands in `msfconsole`

- ### Understanding the Architecture:
	- To fully operate tool, the user must look under its hood.
	
	- By default all the base files related to Metasploit framework can be found under 
		- `/usr/share/metasploit-framework` 
	
	- ### Data, Documentation, Lib:
		- These are the base files for the Framework. 
		- The `Data` and `Lib` are the functioning parts of the `msfconsole`
		- The Documentation folder are the Technical details about the project.

- #### Modules:
	
	- Are the proof-of-concept and actual exploit.
